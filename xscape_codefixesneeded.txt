THE PROBLEM: is about NEXT TIME:

imagine you rename dresses to drold and are creating drnew
drnew is created from the latest webpages
then need to get old descriptions of dresses that matched up
then get list of new dresses that I need to add a description

so lookup drnew$nbr in the drold$nbr, getting drold$title, put that into drnew$title
then look for where is.na(drnew$title), spit out code template to edit


=====================

dresses is 65x11 dataframe
dresses$nbr

need some way that it is clear what dress I am titling, and also stores it in the dataframe as dresses$title 12th column
for dillards, would be good to add title and update sizes, colors in one fell swoop together on a row 

AND then it has to do the replacing in the xs4 vector

AND when N or D change their pages, I have retained and can look up title based on dress nbr, not just on 1:65 because the 1:65 will change!

=====================


dresses$nbr=="3542693" is a TF vector of 65
dresses$title[dresses$nbr=="3542693"] <- "Sheer Feminine Fancy with Elegant Embellishments"

or, but this does not preserve things, however, it would exist in the old dresses df?
dresses$title[1] <- "Sheer Feminine Fancy with Elegant Embellishments"

do I want a separate data frame? (or really 2...)

n_personalize <- data.frame(title=character(), titletext=character(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
n_personalize[ 1, ] <- c("TITLE_01_n3542693", "Sheer Feminine Fancy with Elegant Embellishments")
n_personalize[ 2, ] <- c("TITLE_02_n3882004", "Soft and Sultry with Beaded Lace")
# could replace index with nrow(n_personalize)+1... but I'd rather have the number anyway right?
# but how to generate the 65 or so of above each time?

for (i in 1:nrow(dresses)) {
dresses$title[i] <- n_personalize$titletext[i]
}

d_personalize <- data.frame(title=character(), titletext=character(), 
sizes=character(), colors=character(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

OR: if cols 12 and 13 are title and titletext
dresses[ 1, 12:13] <- c("TITLE_01_n3542693", "Sheer Feminine Fancy with Elegant Embellishments")
dresses[ 2, 12:13] <- c("TITLE_02_n3882004", "Soft and Sultry with Beaded Lace")
